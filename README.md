All the jupyters are in the "My Jupyter Notebooks" folder. Each subfolder is named either after the order of the exercise or its name "e.g. 'Two' or 'Ising'"

The code used to generate all the magic can be found in the Code directory

NOTE: Some jupyterlab notebooks may require some packages to be installed that aren't present by default in Conda or similar

Also it's highly recommended to use JupyterLab instead of Jupyter Notebook because it's prettier and some graphs/Images may not display properly otherwise
